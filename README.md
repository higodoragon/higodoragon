i'm just a dumb brazilian dragon furry that wants to make 
cool video games that people enjoy and remember!~ ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

i'm learning *javascript* and *lua* for now! ( 06/2023 )

i love game modding and map making for games like:
- doom (1993) / doom II
- quake
- half-life 2

especialy because of how these games have such dynamic level-design,
i really respect these game's comunitys making their games live for much much longer!

i love old tech too, be computers, consoles, videogames and software.
i also love retro eletronic music like true chiptune and tracker music.

i do work on a lot projects, but im still trying to finish one. -w-"

let's all work for a free, privite and better internet! üíûÔ∏è
